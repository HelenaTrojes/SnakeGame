# Snake Game

## About The Project

The Snake Game is a classic arcade-style game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This game features smooth animations and a clean, user-friendly interface. The objective is simple: control the snake, eat food, and grow longer while avoiding collisions with the walls and the snake’s own body. This game is responsive and works across different devices.

### Built With
- **HTML5**: For the game structure.
- **CSS3**: For styling the game interface.
- **JavaScript**: For the game logic, including controlling the snake and detecting collisions.
- - **Audio**: Sound effects when eating food and when the game is over.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you need to clone it to your local machine and open the files in a web browser. Below are the steps to set up and run the game.

### Prerequisites:
Before starting, ensure you have the following software installed:

- A web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Code editor (optional but recommended, VS Code)
  
### Installation:
- Clone the Repository or Download the project as a ZIP file
- Navigate to the project folder by typing in the terminal: cd .\SnakeGame
- Install the Live Server extension (if not already installed).
- Right-click the index.html file and select Open with Live Server.
- Your project will be accessible at http://localhost:5500 (or another port if 5500 is occupied).

### Usage
- Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the snake's movement.
- The objective is to eat the food that appears on the screen. Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer.
- Avoid hitting the walls or the snake’s own body.
- The game keeps track of the score, which increases as the snake eats more food.
